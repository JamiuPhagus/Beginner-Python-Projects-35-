# Beginner-Python-Projects-35-
This is a repository containing simple Python projects.
Aim is to help beginners in Python consolidate what they are learning.
It is also to help them see the beauty and fun of practical Python.
It contains lines of code of varying lengths that were used by me to solidify my knowledge of basic python.
You will find some of them incredibly short yet doing amazing stuff.
Code is regularly checked for bugs and updates.
Enjoy, and code away!
